# Heart-Attack-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-



In this section, we will explore and analyze two datasets: "heart-train.csv" and "heart-test.csv." Our primary objectives are to gain insights into the datasets, understand their structures, and prepare the data for further analysis using Python. We will perform data transformations, answer questions, and uncover valuable information related to heart health.

## Introduction

Heart health is a critical aspect of overall well-being. The "heart-train.csv" and "heart-test.csv" datasets provide us with valuable information related to heart health. In this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data, which can help us make informed decisions and predictions regarding heart conditions.

## Dataset Overview

- **"heart-train.csv"**: This dataset serves as our training data and contains various features related to heart health, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more.

- **"heart-test.csv"**: This dataset will be used for testing and validating our analysis and predictions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We will perform exploratory data analysis to better understand the datasets. This process includes:
- Summarizing and visualizing data.
- Identifying patterns, correlations, and outliers.
- Exploring the distribution of key features.
- Describing the general characteristics of the data.

## Data Preprocessing

Before analysis and modeling, we will perform necessary data preprocessing steps, such as:
- Handling missing data.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling and normalizing features.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.

## Questions to Be Addressed

1. What are the key factors that correlate with heart conditions?
2. Can we predict heart disease risk based on available data?
3. How do age, gender, and other variables influence heart health?

## Getting Started

To start exploring and analyzing the heart datasets, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the "heart-train.csv" and "heart-test.csv" datasets and place them in the project directory.

## Dependencies

To run the analysis, you will need the following Python libraries and tools:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Thank you for your interest in our heart dataset analysis project. We are committed to exploring and understanding heart health factors, and we look forward to sharing our insights and findings with the community.
